# Stable Matching with Capacity Expansions
Implementation and comparison of three mathematical programming approaches for school-student matching with capacity expansion under budget constraints.

## Models
1. **Quadratic Model (MIQCP)**: Direct formulation with quadratic stability constraints
2. **Individualized Linearization (MILP)**: Transforms quadratic terms using auxiliary variables
3. **Aggregated Linearization (MILP)**: Groups students by priority levels for efficient linearization

## Dataset
- 1,395 students and 100 school tracks (Magallanes, Chile data)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Gurobi Optimizer
- pandas, numpy
